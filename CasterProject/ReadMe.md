## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base. It is a rectangle with 6 holes equally spaced and one bigger hole between 4 of the holes.

### Reflection

This assignment was easy and my solidworks knowledge made the slight changes to onshape a breeze.

## Mount

### Description

The mount is a piece that goes on top of the base and matches up with the holes from one side of the base.

### Reflection

Again this one was easy because it was essentially making 2/3rds of the base again.
