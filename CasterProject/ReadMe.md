## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base. It is a rectangle with 6 holes equally spaced and one bigger hole between 4 of the holes.

### Reflection

This assignment was easy and my solidworks knowledge made the slight changes to onshape a breeze.

## Mount

### Description

The mount is a piece that goes on top of the base and matches up with the holes from one side of the base.

### Reflection

Again this one was easy because it was essentially making 2/3rds of the base again.

## Fork

### Description

The fork was a small cylinder attached to a wide circle. On the other side of the circle was 2 things that popped out with holes in them to create an area that a small rod type thing could go through both of them.

### Reflection

This was the first project that created a challenge. It was not too hard but on the last step of extruding the 2 fork like things I misplaced them creating some problems down the road that took a while to fix.

## Tire

### Description

The tire is just a black circle with a huge hole in the middle. It also has 2 fillets on the edge to make it look like a tire.

### Reflection

This one was very easy for me and definitely easier than the wheel.
