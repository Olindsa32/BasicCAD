## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base. It is a rectangle with 6 holes equally spaced and one bigger hole between 4 of the holes.

### Reflection

This assignment provided no problem. The assignment talked about doing a linear pattern after creating one circle and that works well. I did the one going 3 wide first and just spaced them manually by 80. Then I did the one by 2 to flip it to the other side. That was the most difficult part of the assignment.

## Mount

### Description

The mount is a piece that goes on top of the base and matches up with the holes from one side of the base. It is a perfect square centered around the large hole from the base.

### Reflection

This one was just as easy as the base maybe easier. Instead of doing a linear sketch pattern like I did on the base since it was a square I could instead do a circular sketch pattern which only took putting 4 on the amount and choosing the center of the square for the rotation point.

## Fork

### Description

The fork was a small cylinder attached to a wide circle. On the other side of the circle was 2 things that popped out with holes in them to create an area that a small rod type thing could go through both of them.

### Reflection

This was the first project that created a challenge. It was not too hard but on the last step of extruding the 2 fork like things I misplaced them creating some problems down the road that took a while to fix.

## Tire

### Description

The tire is just a black circle with a huge hole in the middle. It also has 2 fillets on the edge to make it look like a tire.

### Reflection

This one was very easy for me and definitely easier than the wheel.

## Wheel

### Description

The Wheel is a revolution that gets lotss of holes cut in the middle and sides ti have it resemble a wheel

### Reflection

This project was a bit more of a challenge because you needed to start it the same way as the tire but then make cuts on it and fillets on the cuts.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description

This assingment did not provide much of an issue because it was just 3 simple pieces that later needed to be mated together instead of a big complex piece

### Evidence

### Reflection

Finishing this felt good because in total this caster project had been very fun.

## SubAssmebly

### Description

This assingment is just putting together the wheel tire and a bearing to build the whole wheel shape. The reason for this is to unclutter your full assembly and make everything else more simple.

### Reflection

This was my first time using mates and it went very wheel because mates are extremely easy in onshape.
